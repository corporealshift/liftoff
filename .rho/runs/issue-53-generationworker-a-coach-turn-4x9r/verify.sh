# Verify: "GenerationWorker: a coach turn that ends in `error` retries forever" (brief.md; issue #53).
# Definition of done for this run: exit 0 only when the brief is met.
#
# Order: the CI gate first (.github/workflows/ci.yml runs exactly :app:assembleDebug :app:testDebugUnitTest, and the
# brief names the same two tasks as the gate to run before the PR), then the one test the brief asks for, read out of
# the reports that gate produced.
#
# Gradle exits 0 when a named test never existed, so the test below is looked for by name in this run's reports; a
# test that was never written cannot pass on its own. That is what makes this script fail on untouched code: the name
# under section 2 is new to this branch, and on the untouched branch the gate passes and that name reports "did not
# run": exit 1.
#
# What is NOT checked here, and why:
# - That only `paused` and a dropped connection are handed back and retried. The plan keeps Liftoff's own 20-minute
#   `TimedOut` on that arm too (a plan Decision the owner reviews in the PR). The existing cases that prove the
#   retryable ends stay retryable all run in the gate and must stay green.
# - The plan's Decisions get no test of their own; the owner reviews them in the pull request. That covers: rows
#   already stuck under the old rule being unstuck (the runner no longer treating an `error` behind the stored cursor
#   as already acted on), a cancelled or superseded generation keeping the outcome it already has, `TimedOut` staying
#   on the retry path, the fixed sentence written when the daemon's error names no reason, Retry opening a fresh
#   session, and the DESIGN.md §7.3 amendment.
# - The Launchpad's drawing of a FAILED row. The plan changes no UI and asks for no UI test.
# - Which object carries the daemon's reason, which arm of `storeFinishedTurn` decides, and which class the test
#   sits in: the name below is matched across every report this run wrote.
# - Line endings, commit style, CLAUDE.md's §2 vocabulary, comment length, and the pull-request description.

# session's error text), not null; nothing is stored; the session is given up; and no rho.session.resume frame was
# sent, which is the half that stops the endless retry. On the untouched tree the same turn returns Result.retry()
